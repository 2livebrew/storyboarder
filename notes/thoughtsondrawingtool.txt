Thoughts on drawing tool:

line tool for shift 


margins outside
  many board artists like the margins on the board. They can complete their drawings, reframe, work in transitions. 
  other nice thing is not losing the drawing on reframing. this is not hard to do, I'm thinking I'll implement in near future.

  DOWNSIDES
    need to keep a bigger image
    need ui to turn on and off border

better pen tool input
  currently, the pen input is loosely appoximates for drawing. It's fine for slower brush moves, but can really mess up for bigger ones. 
  I think pen input should be recorded on stroke, draw live, but also periodically reapproximated and redrawn. This will result in immediate results, that fix themselves over time

  DOWNSIDES
    could be hard
  
layers?
  currently there is only one layer. this is great for paperlike simplicity. However a lot of board artists want 1) at least a background layer. something that is fixed that they can draw on top of. 2) a roughs layer. currently, you draw roughs and you draw over the top of them. in the other case, you would want to use roughs as a guide and be able to make them disappear.

  MAJOR DOWNSIDES
    ui becomes way more complex. needs a layer ui visible at all times. one school of thought: you are boarding, not making final art. So does it really matter? does the complexity merit the new feature? also, this tool should be used for non artists, and non technical artists alike. Layers often overcomplicate things.

    we would have to store more layers and a composite board.

    could enable layers as an advanced feature

zooming?

  zooming out and drawing is important for roughing and getting the bigger picture. zooming in is important for detail work.

  DOWNSIDES
    ui but shouldnt be that complicated if using standard ui things like mousewheel and space to pan.
