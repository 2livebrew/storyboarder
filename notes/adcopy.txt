Storyboarder

Why?

  1) storyboard an existing story
  2) use storyboarding to help create the story

Why this tool?

  Storyboarding is an extrmely simple act. In fact, you can easily do it with a few sheets of paper and a pencil. But as you continue to draw more boards, you end up with tons of drawings. You have to keep them in order and number them. Reordering and editing is a major task.

  Storyboarder organizes your board drawings for you. 

  It's really that simple. In fact, if the interface of Storyboarder looks even the slightest bit complicated to you, that's our fault, because it should be as simple as making a flipbook. The hard part is coming up what to put in your story. That's all you - we can't do any of that. Storyboarder is simply a tool that tries to reduce the friction of visually telling as fast as you can think.

Who is this for?

  Writers

  Writer Directors

  Story Artists

  Anyone with an idea


Storyboarder simply allows you to visually board your stories as fast as you possibly can.

Either work from a written story, or create a completely new board file. Create a board, draw in it, create a board, draw in it, and start to see your story come to life. You can also print out worksheets, draw on them, and easily import them.

Let's get started.


Storyboarder is for storyboarding FAST AS FUCK.

Go from idea in your head to storyboard as fast as possible.

NEW BOARD

NEW BOARD
DONE.

Don't get slowed down by too many buttons or options. You're here to board stories, not make the next Moner Lisa.

Works with Pens on any tablet or Cintiq or even a Microsoft Surface. Also works with a mouse.

We have 4 brush types which are all you need to draw fast:

Light pencil for roughing
Pencil for fast sketching
Pen for inking strong lines
Brush for filling in some shading

You can also specificy 3 brush sizes for each type.

Each brush has it's own 5 color pallete. You can set all the colors as you like.

There are no layers. Again, you're boarding story ideas. Managing layers creates so much uneeded complexity and ui mess. A board artist that uses layers probably voted for Trump - or paid way too much for "Pro" storyboard software.

Made a mistake? You can erase that shit.

You can undo and redo.

Made a big mistake? You can clear the whole thing.

If its off center or too big or too small, you can shift your drawing around or scale it.

Need a straight line? Hold shift while you're drawing and you got straight lines.

There are 5 guide overlays to toggle:
  Grid
  Center Marks
  Thirds
  Angles
  Onion skin (previous and next board in shot)

We got mad simple key commands:

  COMMAND+1 = light pencil
  COMMAND+2 = pencil
  COMMAND+3 = pen
  COMMAND+4 = brush

  COMMAND+DELETE = clear

  COMMAND+Z = undo
  COMMAND+Y = redo

  COMMAND+6 = color 1
  COMMAND+7 = color 2
  COMMAND+8 = color 3
  COMMAND+9 = color 4
  COMMAND+0 = color 5

  [ = smaller brush
  ] = bigger brush

  HOLD SHIFT WHILE DRAWING = straight lines

  HOLD COMMAND = move contents
  COMMAND+OPTION = scale contents

  HOLD OPTION = color pick

"CHARLES, I RESPEKT UR OPINIONATED SOFTWARE DESIGN GANGSTER, BUT I NEED TO POLISH MY DRAWINGS TIGHTER."
No problem, needy bruh. You can click a button to edit in photoshop, and when you save, it updates in Storyboarder.

"CHARLES, STORYBOARDER IS REVOLUTIONARY. PERHAPS BIGGER THAN JESUS AND WRESTLING. - Saul Bass"
Fuck you, Saul Bass. Absolutely bigger than Jesus and wrestling. Also, your work output has really dropped off in recent years.

"HOW COME WHEN I'M DRAWING, I HEAR THE EMPERIAL MARCH?"
You're probably boarding on the Simpsons. You might want to escape North Korea through China. If not shot crossing the river, you will probably be sold into slavery by the Chinese. Work for 5 years, buy your freedom and make your way to Seoul. This should fix your issue. You're welcome.
